# Quantaformis Reactions: The theme of this chemical is 'alien optimization.'
# When adding a reaction, try to make it sort of a monkey's paw kind of deal, take the chemicals used and make them into a "better version" of them.
# Try to stick to this theme so that other things in the future can still have a niche.
