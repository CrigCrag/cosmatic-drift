reagent-name-agitaseptici = agitaseptici
reagent-desc-agitaseptici = An odd species of space bacterium that is incredibly resilient. It thrives off of certain mixtures of medication. It feeds on amoeba and their eggs, regardless of whether they're symbiotic or parasitic.

reagent-name-putrescamoeba = putrescamoeba
reagent-desc-putrescamoeba = A resilient species of parasitic space amoeba that feeds on spoiled meat. Almost immediately lays eggs and dies once inside a host. 

reagent-name-eggsputrescamoeba = putrescamoeba eggs
reagent-desc-eggsputrescamoeba = The eggs of a parasitic amoeba. They require water to hatch and grow, but do so rapidly. They cause dehydration in the host in an attempt to get them to drink water and repeat the cycle.

reagent-name-quantaformis = quantaformis
reagent-desc-quantaformis = A mysterious microorganism that doesn't fit any known classifications. It seems to be bioluminescent, but only in the light. Further study is required.
