# Razorium
When treating a patient who has brute and burn damage, watch out! Using Bicaridine and Dermaline at the same time will cause them to react and form Razorium.

To avoid this, either verify that the Bicaridine has left the patient's system before injected Dermaline (and vice versa), or use specialized brute medication.
# Specialized Brute Chemicals

Luckily for you, Nanotrasen's greatest scientists have synthesized three brute chemicals that don't react with much! Each one heals a specific damage subtype!

# Bacterial Contamination

[color=red]USE CAUTION[/color] when using the aforementioned specialized brute chemicals. Should one mix together with a different type of brute chemical, the resulting mixture will culture a dangerous bacteria known as Agitaseptici.
<GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Agitaseptici"/>
To avoid this, make sure the patient is done metabolizing one brute medication before giving them another. Keep an eye on the rate their health is changing.

## Some examples of mixtures that culture Agitaseptici are as follows:
Bicaridine and Puncturase
Puncturase and Lacerinol
Bruizine and Bicaridine
Lacerinol and Bruizine

Please note that [bold]any[/bold] combination of these 4 chemicals will likely culture Agitaseptici.

# Dealing with infection

So, you messed up and got your patient infected with Agitaseptici. It'll be in their bloodstream for a while, so prescribe them some poison medication or use charcoal to get it out.
